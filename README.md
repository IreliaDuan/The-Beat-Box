# The Beat Box
Irelia Duan

#Summary 
The beat box project is using Led lights to display the volume and beatsthrough the analog sound sensor. It uses analog sound sensor to sense the volume, the volume higher LED darker, and the volume lower LED lighter. Also, it detects sound every 0.05 second, so the LED could follow the beats of the music.
I think my project should be slow interaction.The concept of my project basically is LED light interacts with the music and beats. User could choose the music which they like and enjoy the LED display for the volume and the beat.
